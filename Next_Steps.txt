## Step By Step plan
Based on our discussion and the recommendations, here’s a step-by-step plan for your next phase:

Centralize & Clean Up Configurations:

Move all constants (e.g., DB paths, date ranges, initial investment, indicator thresholds) into your existing config.py.
Update your scripts (Dash app, technical signals, backtesting, fundamentals, etc.) to import from this single configuration file. This ensures consistency and simplifies future changes.
Refactor SQL Access & Optimize Queries:

Change raw SQL string formatting in your scripts (especially in the Dash app) to use parameterized queries.
Review and possibly adjust your SQL schema by:
Ensuring proper indexing on columns you frequently query (e.g., (ticker, date) for price data, (ticker, analysis_date) for fundamentals).
Considering incremental updates for technical signals and fundamentals rather than full recalculations each time.
Consider caching frequently used data (like ticker lists or recent price data) in memory if your data volumes allow.
Reorganize Your Code Structure:

Modularize by Functionality:
Create sub-packages within your scripts/ folder. For example, move files related to technical analysis (signals, backtesting, optimization) into a technical/ package and those related to fundamentals (CAPM, Fama-French, Monte Carlo) into a fundamental/ package.
Clarify Script Roles:
Clearly separate scripts that are used for one-time data fetching (like fetch_price.py, fetch_tickers.py), those for ongoing analysis (like run_analysis_fundamental.py), and those for live visualization (like dash_app.py). Consider adding a master script or Makefile that outlines the proper execution order.
Integrate Fundamentals into the Dash App:

Add new tabs or sections in your Dash layout to display fundamental data (CAPM expected returns, beta values, Fama-French factors, etc.).
Create callbacks that query your SQL tables for fundamental analysis results based on the selected ticker. Display these results in tables or charts alongside the technical signals.
Optionally, start a simple integration by filtering technical signals: for example, only show a “buy” marker if the fundamental expected return is positive. This will be your first composite signal.
Set Up Regular Updates:

Implement a scheduled or on-demand job (e.g., via a cron job or a Dash Interval component) to update technical signals and fundamental analysis results in your SQL database.
This ensures that the data presented in your Dash app is always up-to-date without having to recompute everything from scratch on each user interaction.
Prototype an Integrated Strategy:

Begin with a simple version that combines the technical signals with fundamental metrics. For example, modify your backtesting function to only consider a technical “buy” if the CAPM/Fama-French expected return or alpha meets a certain threshold.
Backtest this integrated strategy on a subset of tickers and review performance. Use these results to iterate on your signal combination logic.
Enhance and Validate Your Backtesting Framework:

Consider expanding your backtest to simulate a multi-ticker portfolio rather than testing each stock in isolation.
Incorporate realistic trading costs, and log trade details to help analyze performance.
Once satisfied with the integrated strategy, update the results in your SQL database and visualize them in the Dash app.
Plan Future Enhancements:

Once the integrated dashboard is up and running, you can explore further improvements like adding Monte Carlo simulations for efficient frontier visualization, optimizing parameters, or even deploying the app for live (or paper) trading.
Document each change, and update your project outline and README to reflect the new structure and capabilities.




### Enhancements ###

## Dash App
Overall, dash_app.py ties together database queries, technical analysis, and visualization. It ensures the latest data and signals are presented to the user in real-time by querying the
DB and computing signals within the callback. This design works for analysis but can be computationally heavy if data volumes grow or if many users access it simultaneously, as each 
ticker selection triggers data load and signal computation anew. The backtest results are computed on the fly and kept in memory for display, rather than being fetched from a stored table 
(though the framework provides a table for backtest results if needed). The backtesting_results table schema includes an auto ID, test_date, strategy_name, total_return, sharpe_ratio, max_drawdown​.
In the current implementation, the Dash app doesn’t query this table; instead, it directly uses the DataFrame. But having results in SQL can be useful for record-keeping or comparing strategies over time.

## Technical Signals and Usage in Dash
In summary, the technical signals module encapsulates all the logic for indicator calculation and signal generation. It ensures consistency by using one function (apply_trading_strategy)
both for database updates and for real-time computations. All buy/sell decisions are thus based on this unified signal, which is crucial for aligning the backtesting and live analysis. 
One observation is that the signals stored in the DB could be leveraged more in the Dash app for efficiency – currently the integration is present but not fully utilized in real-time 
plotting. Currently, the Dash app does not query the technical_signals table; instead it recomputes signals on the fly for display. However, the existence of this table means the system 
can store precomputed signals (e.g., via a scheduled batch job) and potentially retrieve them quickly for the dashboard or other analysis, rather than recalculating each time. 
The design currently runs a full backtest at app start (which could be slow) and does not update thereafter, meaning any new data or signals wouldn’t reflect until the app is restarted 
or the function is rerun. There is room to make this on-demand or incremental, but as is, it provides a one-time snapshot of strategy performance for all tickers which is then 
interactively explored via the UI.

## SQL 
Data Retrieval Patterns: The code often pulls large sets of data. For example, update_technical_signals selects all price data at once​, and the backtest loads the entire price history 
into memory​. While SQLite can handle moderate data sizes, these approaches may become slow if the dataset grows (Nasdaq-100 over 20+ years daily can be sizable, and loading all tickers 
might take time and memory). However, once loaded, in-memory operations (grouping by ticker, vectorized computations) are fast in Pandas. There’s a trade-off between fewer large queries 
vs. many small queries. The current approach minimizes the number of database hits (which is good for SQLite), but at the cost of higher memory usage.
One possible inefficiency is having separate tables for CAPM vs Fama-French expected returns if they share similar structure – combining them into one table with columns for both models 
or a model identifier could simplify retrieval. But separate tables can be fine for clarity and if using unique ticker keys (since each ticker will have one CAPM and one FF entry).
The major improvements would come from either reducing the volume of data pulled per query (when unnecessary) or adding indexes for new query patterns. As the project expands, keeping an 
eye on query execution time (using EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN in SQLite for example) can indicate if new indexes are needed. Given that the backtest and signal updates load all data, one could 
consider incremental updates (only new data since last run) or more targeted queries per ticker to save memory, but the current method is simple and ensures complete recalculations for 
accuracy.

## Fundamentals 
CAPM’s expected return for a stock gives a fundamental benchmark – if our technical strategy’s forecast or performance deviates, we can use it to adjust expectations. For example, a stock 
with very low CAPM expected return might be treated with caution even if technicals give a buy signal.
Fama-French can highlight if a stock’s returns are driven by size or value characteristics. Integrating this, one could, for instance, avoid a stock whose expected return is low or whose 
alpha is negative, even if technicals are positive – or adjust position sizing based on the confidence from fundamental factors.

## Strategy Improvements
Filtering/Confirming Signals: e.g., only take technical buy signals for stocks that have a positive expected return and/or positive alpha from CAPM/Fama-French. This ensures fundamental 
outlook agrees with technical triggers.
Adjusting Thresholds: If Monte Carlo optimization suggests certain stocks should have higher weight (perhaps due to high expected return per unit risk), the strategy might prioritize 
signals from those stocks or require a lower confirmation threshold for them.
Dynamic Allocation: The efficient frontier results (optimal weights) could be used to allocate capital among the signals. For instance, if technical signals indicate buying 10 stocks, 
the proportions of capital invested in each could follow the optimal weights derived (tilted by fundamental expected returns). This merges the top-down (portfolio optimization) with 
bottom-up (signal picking) approaches.
Risk Management: CAPM beta can inform position sizing – a high-beta stock might be given a smaller allocation or require a stronger technical signal to act on, to control portfolio
volatility. Similarly, Monte Carlo simulations could estimate the portfolio’s Value at Risk or probability of loss, leading to more conservative or aggressive strategy adjustments.
As of now, the fundamental analysis appears to be run separately (via scripts like run_analysis_fundamental.py or similar) and results are stored, but the Dash app’s strategy is 
purely technical. The “integrated” CSV outputs suggest there were experiments in combining them, but the Dash UI doesn’t yet show fundamental data or use it in real-time. Thus, there 
is an opportunity to explicitly integrate these models: for example, adding another tab in the Dash app for fundamental analysis (showing expected returns for each stock, factor 
exposures, etc.), and an integrated strategy tab that might illustrate how a combined strategy performs (perhaps those integrated_optimal_portfolios results).





### Other LLM Recommendations ###

Optimize SQL Query Efficiency
Batch and Cache Data: To reduce repeated heavy queries, consider loading certain data once and reusing it. For example, the list of tickers changes rarely, so query it once at startup (as is done) and reuse that list rather than querying each time. Similarly, loading all price data for backtesting is expensive; if memory permits, keep a cached copy of price_df or split it by ticker and cache those DataFrames. This way, the Dash callback can fetch data from an in-memory object instead of hitting the database on every ticker selection. Alternatively, use SQLite’s query efficiency by selecting only needed columns and date ranges (which you are largely doing). Ensuring the nasdaq_100_daily_prices table has an index on (ticker, date) (which it does​
FILE-EVZGZ2YWGQC6AQCWBQCRYA
) is key for performance – that should be maintained if the table is updated frequently.
Use Parameterized Queries: Where possible, switch to parameterized SQL queries instead of Python string formatting. For instance, in update_graph, the query can use WHERE ticker = ? and pass the selected_ticker as a parameter to pd.read_sql_query. This is safer and can allow the SQLite engine to reuse query plans. Although the risk of injection is low here, it’s a good practice as the project grows and possibly takes user input.
Avoid Unnecessary Data Retrieval: Audit where large queries are made and see if the full breadth of data is needed. The update_technical_signals function pulls all tickers’ data; if run frequently, this could be optimized by updating only the latest data. You could modify it to only fetch prices for dates not yet in technical_signals (or simply delete and recalc for the last X days rather than entire history each time). Similarly, for backtesting, if only the final metrics are needed for display, perhaps run the heavy backtest less often (on-demand or on a schedule) and store results in the DB for Dash to read. This way, the Dash app start isn’t slowed by computing the backtest each time.
Database Vacuum and Index Tuning: Over time, especially with many inserts (e.g., if fundamental analysis results or technical signals are frequently updated and old ones removed via the cleanup routine), consider running VACUUM on the SQLite database occasionally to optimize file size and performance. Ensure the indexes match query patterns: for example, if you often query technical_signals by date range (not just exact dates), an index on date alone or maintaining the data sorted by date can help retrieval. As new features add queries (like retrieving top N stocks by expected return, or filtering backtest results by strategy name), create indexes on those columns (such as backtesting_results.strategy_name) to keep look-ups fast.
Scalability Consideration: If the dataset or usage grows (say, adding more stocks or higher frequency data), monitor query times. SQLite might become a bottleneck for concurrent reads/writes. In that case, migrating to a more robust SQL engine (PostgreSQL/MySQL) or using an in-memory data store for real-time quotes could be considered. For now, the current approach is acceptable, but adding asynchronous updates (e.g., fetching new prices in the background, then updating the Dash components) can help maintain UI responsiveness. Dash offers the dcc.Interval component to trigger updates – use this with caution to not spam the DB, perhaps updating once a day or as new data comes in.
Improve Project File Organization
Modularize by Functionality: The project’s scripts/ directory contains many Python files (for fetching data, computing signals, optimization, etc.). Organize these into sub-packages or modules grouped by theme. For example, create a package technical containing signals.py, backtest.py, optimization.py related to technical analysis, and a package fundamental for CAPM, Fama-French, and expected returns computation. This way, related functions and classes live together, improving maintainability. You can still have a main app.py or dash_app.py that imports from these modules.
Consolidate Configuration: Use a single config.py (which you have) or a YAML/JSON config for parameters that are reused across files (database path, default dates, initial investment, thresholds, etc.). In the code, we see constants like START_DATE and INIT_VALUE defined in multiple places (dash_app, possibly backtest script)​
FILE-EVZGZ2YWGQC6AQCWBQCRYA
. It would be cleaner to define these once in config.py and import them, to avoid divergence. Similarly, logging setup could be centralized so all modules use a consistent logger configuration (some modules log to logs/project.log, Dash logs to dash_app.log, etc. – ensure this is intentional).
Avoid Redundancy: Check for duplicate functionality. There are indications that fundamental results might be handled in two ways (the code snippet for inserting CAPM results manually creating tables​
FILE-EVZGZ2YWGQC6AQCWBQCRYA
 vs a separate create_tables function​
FILE-EVZGZ2YWGQC6AQCWBQCRYA
 that also creates a simpler table). Standardize on one approach. If both detailed and summary fundamental data are needed, document their purpose (e.g., one table for full regression results per run, another for latest expected returns). Remove or refactor scripts that overlap (for instance, if db_setup.py and db_utils.py both create connections, maybe keep one connection utility).
Clear Entry Points: Identify the scripts that are meant to be executed directly vs imported. For example, dash_app.py is run to start the server. Perhaps fetch_price.py or fetch_tickers.py are one-time setup scripts. Provide a README or comments on the order of execution (it seems you fetch tickers, fetch historical prices, run fundamental analysis, run optimization, then run the app). This helps future maintainers (or yourself later) know how to update or re-run parts of the project. Consider a single run_all.py or a Makefile to orchestrate the data update pipeline.
Documentation and Comments: The code already has docstrings explaining each script’s purpose, which is great. Expand on this by adding more comments in complex sections (like explaining the math in Fama-French calculation or the reason behind certain threshold choices in signals). Also, update the README with how the technical and fundamental parts integrate. This makes the repository more approachable and maintainable, especially as you consider merging fundamental and technical strategies (which should be well-documented for clarity).
By reorganizing the files and modules in a logical structure, you’ll make the project easier to navigate and extend. Future additions (say, adding a new technical indicator or a new fundamental factor model) would fit naturally into this structure without becoming cluttered. Remember to update import statements accordingly when reorganizing, and test that everything still works after moving things around.
Integrate Data for Real-Time Dash Analysis
Combine Views in Dash: Extend the Dash app to include the fundamental data and optimized portfolios alongside technical signals. For instance, add a new tab or new sections that display fundamental metrics for the selected ticker (CAPM expected return, beta, Fama-French expected return, etc.). This could be a simple table or text output in the app showing, “Expected Annual Return (CAPM): X%, (Fama-French): Y%,” whenever a ticker is selected. Since you have the data in the database (or CSV), you can query the fundamental_analysis_capm and fundamental_analysis_ff tables for the selected ticker and show those results in Dash. This real-time access to fundamental info will enrich the analysis, allowing the user to see why a signal might be good or bad (e.g., the stock has strong expected returns fundamentally, supporting the technical buy signal).
Overlay Fundamental Signals: If you’ve derived any simple signals from fundamentals (like “undervalued” if expected return > actual historical avg return, or a rating based on alpha), consider integrating that into the graph or as an annotation. For example, you might mark periods where a stock’s expected return was updated and whether the technical strategy was aligned. This would require aligning dates of fundamental analysis with the price timeline. It’s advanced, but can provide insight into how often fundamentals and technicals agree.
Real-Time Updates: Currently, the app is likely using static historical data. For a more real-time analysis, set up a job to update the price data regularly (maybe daily or intraday if possible using an API like yfinance). With Dash, you can use an Interval component to periodically refresh certain data (e.g., refresh the backtest table weekly, or refresh price data daily). Ensure that update_technical_signals and backtest functions can be run incrementally so you don’t have to recompute everything from scratch each time. One approach: schedule update_technical_signals nightly to update the DB with the latest day’s signals, and have Dash callbacks pull the latest signals directly from the technical_signals table for the graph rather than recomputing. The UI will then always reflect up-to-date computations without manual intervention.
Leverage Stored Signals: As mentioned, the technical_signals table holds precomputed signals. You can modify the Dash app’s graph update to use these for speed: instead of calling apply_trading_strategy in the callback (which recalculates indicators), you could query technical_signals for the selected ticker’s signal and relevant indicator values. This would turn the callback into mostly a database read (which is fast with indexing) and plotting task, saving CPU. If you do this, ensure that the technical_signals table is kept updated. You might run update_technical_signals as part of your data fetch pipeline whenever new price data comes in.
Merge Backtest with Live Data: The backtest shown in the app is as of app start. For more dynamic analysis, you could allow the user to trigger a backtest from the UI (for example, a button “Run Backtest” that executes backtest_trading_strategy and updates the table). This could be paired with controls for backtest parameters (start date, initial capital) in the Dash app, making it interactive. However, be mindful of performance; you might restrict it to one ticker at a time or a subset, or run a precomputed backtest for common scenarios. At minimum, consider updating the backtest results periodically (so if the market moves or the strategy is changed, the table isn’t stale).
Efficient Frontier in Dash: Since Monte Carlo results and optimal portfolios are part of the project, you could add a visualization of the efficient frontier or the recommended optimal portfolio in the Dash app. For instance, a graph of volatility vs return for random portfolios, highlighting the frontier, and marking the chosen portfolio weights. This could update whenever fundamental inputs change. It might be a separate tab, but it ties the fundamental analysis into a tangible recommendation that the user can see and potentially compare with the technical strategy performance.
By integrating all these data points into the Dash app, you transform it from a pure technical trading dashboard into a comprehensive platform where a user can see technical signals, fundamental expectations, and portfolio optimization outcomes in one place. This real-time, holistic view will make analysis more convenient and insightful. Just be cautious to keep the interface responsive – if certain computations are heavy (Monte Carlo, full backtests), consider precomputing or asynchronous callbacks so the UI doesn’t freeze.
Merge Fundamental Models with Technical Signals
Composite Signal Development: Create a combined trading signal that accounts for both technical and fundamental indicators. One approach is a scoring system: for example, use the existing technical overall_signal (1, 0, -1) and modulate it by a fundamental score (say +1 if expected return is above a threshold or alpha is positive, -1 if negative). The simplest integration: require dual confirmation. Only execute a buy if technical signal = 1 and fundamental outlook is positive. Only sell/short if technical = -1 and fundamentals are poor. This could reduce false signals. You might backtest variations of this: does filtering by fundamentals improve Sharpe or reduce drawdowns? The framework can support this: you’d fetch fundamental data in the backtest loop and adjust the entries accordingly.
Use Expected Return in Position Sizing: Instead of a binary filter, use the magnitude of expected return to size positions or decide which signals to prioritize. For instance, if you have multiple simultaneous buy signals, allocate more capital to stocks with higher CAPM expected return or higher “alpha”. In practice, during backtesting, when the portfolio enters a buy signal for multiple tickers, you could split the capital proportionally to their expected returns (or Sharpe ratios). This merges efficient frontier thinking with the signal timing – you invest more in fundamentally attractive opportunities. You’d need to adjust the backtest logic from single-ticker to multi-ticker portfolio simulation for this (vectorbt can handle multi-asset portfolios). This is a more complex but powerful integration.
Factor-Based Signal Adjustment: Incorporate factor model outputs into technical strategy decisions. For example, if a stock’s Fama-French analysis shows a high beta to the market and the market trend is down, you might be more cautious on a buy signal (since the stock might drop with the market). Or if the stock has a strong size or value tilt, macro news affecting those factors could be included. While this might be beyond the current scope, it suggests using fundamental insights (like “this stock behaves like a small-cap, which are underperforming”) to modulate technical trades (maybe require a stronger technical signal or a shorter holding period in such cases).
Feedback into Optimization: Once you have an integrated signal or strategy, use Monte Carlo or traditional optimization on that strategy. For instance, optimize the combination of strategies: one could allocate between a pure technical strategy vs a pure fundamental strategy. Or use scenario analysis (Monte Carlo) to see how a combined approach performs under different market conditions (e.g., if the market risk premium changes, does the strategy still hold up?). This could guide tweaks to the signal generation (maybe the threshold of 3 indicators in overall_signal could be optimized differently for high vs low expected-return stocks).
Automate Portfolio Rebalancing: If fundamental data suggests an optimal portfolio weight for each stock (as per efficient frontier), and technical signals suggest timing, you can merge them by rebalancing the portfolio according to those weights whenever technical signals allow. For example, your optimal portfolio might say 10% in AAPL, 8% in MSFT, etc. You don’t hold all 100% all the time, but when technical signals indicate an entry, you move toward that allocation, and when exit signals appear, you reduce exposure. This ensures that when you are in the market, you’re close to the best fundamental portfolio mix. Implementation-wise, this could mean the backtest needs to handle partial positions and continuous rebalancing (vectorbt can simulate that if set up with target weights or periodic reallocation).
Testing and Validation: Any merged model should be carefully backtested (which your framework can do). It’s recommended to create new backtest scenarios for the combined strategy and compare metrics. You might find, for instance, that filtering out technically-driven trades for stocks with poor expected returns improves the Sharpe ratio significantly at the cost of some returns – or vice versa. Use these results to iteratively refine how you weight technical vs fundamental inputs. Keep track of these tests in the backtesting_results table or separate logs for analysis.
Merging fundamental and technical approaches can yield a more robust strategy that performs well under different regimes. The key is to ensure the combined strategy remains coherent and not overly complex (to avoid curve-fitting). Start simple (such as confirmation filters) and gradually experiment with deeper integration (like dynamic weighting), using the data and tools you have to measure the impact.
Enhance the Backtesting Framework
Incorporate Transaction Costs and Constraints: Realistic backtesting should account for trading friction like commissions, slippage, bid-ask spreads, and perhaps liquidity constraints. Vectorbt likely allows specifying fees or slippage in Portfolio.from_signals. Adding a small transaction fee (or a percentage spread) will make the backtest results more realistic, especially if the strategy trades frequently. Also consider if the strategy allows shorting or only long positions – currently overall_signal uses -1 for sell which might imply going short or going to cash. Clarify and implement whether -1 means short or just exit to cash. If shorting is allowed, incorporate borrowing costs and ensure the backtest reflects that.
Multi-Ticker Portfolio Backtest: As noted, right now each ticker is backtested in isolation and results are listed per ticker​
FILE-EVZGZ2YWGQC6AQCWBQCRYA
. A valuable enhancement is to simulate a portfolio holding multiple stocks concurrently based on signals. For example, you could test an equal-weight strategy: whenever each stock has a buy signal, invest an equal portion of capital in it. This would require constructing a combined time series or using vectorbt in a multi-asset mode. The outcome will show the overall portfolio equity curve, Sharpe, etc., rather than treating stocks separately. It can reveal how diversification helps (or not) and how simultaneous signals are handled. You could still store per-ticker results, but also have an “All-together” strategy result.
Parameter Optimization and Sensitivity: Utilize the optimize_sma_windows function (or extend it) to see how sensitive the strategy is to parameters like the SMA short/long window lengths, the RSI period, or the threshold of 3 indicators for a signal. By iterating through parameter values and logging performance, you might discover better settings or at least ranges that work well. This could be partially automated: for example, run backtests for threshold 2, 3, 4… and compare Sharpe ratios. Document these findings. If certain parameters significantly improve performance historically, incorporate them, but also be cautious of overfitting. Monte Carlo simulation could be extended to strategy parameters: randomly generate a set of indicator parameters and evaluate performance to get a distribution of outcomes (this is like a Monte Carlo of strategy rather than portfolio).
Store Detailed Results: Currently, the backtest stores summary metrics. You might want to store or inspect the equity curve or trades of the strategy. For instance, how volatile was the strategy day-to-day, or what were the dates of the worst drawdowns? Consider saving daily portfolio values or at least the trade log for analysis. Vectorbt can provide trade records; you can dump these to a CSV or database table (perhaps a backtesting_trades table with columns: date, ticker, action, price, portfolio_value). This level of detail helps diagnose issues or explain performance.
User-Friendly Backtesting in Dash: As mentioned, adding controls in the Dash app to trigger or customize backtests could be a nice feature. You could allow the user to pick a subset of tickers to backtest (e.g., just the tech sector stocks) or test different strategies (maybe toggle certain indicators on/off). To support this, structure your backtest function to accept parameters like list of indicators to use, threshold, etc. This turns your app into a mini research platform. Just ensure to manage execution time (possibly run such backtests asynchronously and display a loading indicator or use caching for repeated runs).
Comparison of Strategies: If you develop multiple strategies (technical-only, fundamental-only, integrated, buy-and-hold, etc.), build a comparison dashboard. For example, a bar chart of Sharpe ratios for each strategy, or a line chart with multiple equity curves. This will help illustrate the value added by your enhancements. It could simply read from the backtesting_results table (with different strategy_name entries​
FILE-EVZGZ2YWGQC6AQCWBQCRYA
) and plot those. Since the table stores a test_date, you can keep a history of strategy tweaks and how they performed at the time of analysis.
Improving the backtesting framework ensures that when you refine your strategy, you can trust the results and get deeper insights. By accounting for real-world frictions and testing portfolio-level outcomes, you move closer to a deployable strategy. It also makes your research more rigorous – you can demonstrate how each change affects performance and why the final strategy was chosen.
Future Steps and Expansion
Live Trading Integration: If the ultimate goal is to use this strategy in practice, consider how to connect it to live or paper trading. This could involve using broker APIs (like Alpaca, IB, etc.) to fetch real-time prices and execute trades when signals occur. Your system, with some adaptation, could serve as a decision engine: the technical signals computed daily could trigger trade orders. Before this, you’d need to incorporate a schedule (e.g., run at market close to decide next day’s trades) and ensure robustness (error handling, no lookahead in backtest vs live).
Additional Data and Features: Expand the fundamental analysis beyond CAPM and Fama-French. For instance, include company financial metrics (P/E ratios, earnings growth, etc.) or macro indicators that could affect the Nasdaq-100 stocks. Sentiment analysis (news or social media) could also be an interesting addition. Each new data source can be integrated into the existing framework – for example, a sentiment score could become another factor in the trading signal or a filter for risky trades. Make sure to update the data schema and storage for new information (add new tables as needed, with indexes for access).
Machine Learning Models: With a rich dataset of technical indicators, fundamental factors, and historical outcomes, you could experiment with machine learning to generate signals or rankings. For example, a classification model could learn to predict buy/sell signals (or profitable vs unprofitable periods) from the technical + fundamental inputs. This would be a complex project, but potentially rewarding. If doing so, keep it as a supplement to the rule-based approach, so you can compare and perhaps combine them (ensemble approach).
Refine Monte Carlo and Optimization: The current Monte Carlo approach for portfolio weights can be upgraded to a more analytical solution (solving for the efficient frontier using quadratic programming for instance). This would give exact optimal portfolios rather than approximate via random sampling. Additionally, consider scenario analysis: simulate not just random weights, but random market conditions (changes in expected returns or volatilities) to see how the optimal portfolio or strategy holds up. This is more of a stress test for your strategy.
User Experience Improvements: On the Dash app side, focus on clarity and usability. Add explanations or tooltips for what each graph or table means (e.g., hover info that explains technical indicators when you mouse over a signal marker). Ensure the app is responsive (Dash can be made to work on various screen sizes) so that others can easily view it. If you plan to share it, consider deploying it on a server (Heroku, Dash Enterprise, etc.) and think about security (the database contains your data; if deploying publicly, you might want a read-only user or to cache data to avoid exposing the raw database).
Regular Maintenance Tasks: As the database grows with new data (price updates, repeated fundamental analyses), implement maintenance tasks like the cleanup_database.py you have. It’s already ensuring only the latest fundamental records per ticker are kept​
FILE-EVZGZ2YWGQC6AQCWBQCRYA
​
FILE-EVZGZ2YWGQC6AQCWBQCRYA
. Continue this practice for other tables if needed (e.g., if you store daily technical signals indefinitely, it might become huge – you could archive old signals or compress them). Also backup your data.db regularly, especially after major analyses, to not lose the historical results.
